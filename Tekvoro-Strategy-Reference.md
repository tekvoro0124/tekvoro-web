## 🎯 POSITIONING PROMPT

Use this when writing website copy, LinkedIn posts, proposals, or any AI prompt for marketing content:

```
Tekvoro Technologies is a Hyderabad-based AI platform development company 
specializing in building complex, production-grade marketplaces and SaaS 
products for Indian startups and SMBs.

Our flagship proof: We built QuickMela — a full-featured AI-powered auction 
marketplace platform with real-time bidding, AI fraud detection (Graph Neural 
Network shill detection, bot fingerprinting), iDfy KYC integration with 
liveness detection, WhatsApp NLP bot (Gemini 1.5 Flash), multi-language voice 
support (8 Indian languages via Sarvam AI), live video streaming, escrow 
payment management, and a 22-panel admin command center.

We are NOT a generic IT company. We are platform specialists. We build the 
kind of AI-native products that take most agencies 12+ months — in 90 days.

Target clients:
- Funded Indian startups (Series A/B) building marketplace/fintech products
- US/UK/UAE founders building India-market products
- Indian SMBs (₹10-200Cr revenue) going digital
- Businesses wanting to launch their own auction/trading platform (white-label)

Our edge: We have end-to-end proof. Real code. Real AI. Real complexity. 
Not mockups. Not demos. Working, deployable platforms.

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX (Ranked by Revenue Impact)

### 🔴 CRITICAL — Fix in Week 1

**1. Website is Google-invisible**
- Problem: JavaScript SPA with no SSR. Google sees only `<title>` tag. Zero organic search.
- Fix: Migrate to Next.js with SSR, or add Prerender.io service
- Cost: 3-5 developer days
- Revenue impact: Every month delayed = more competitors outrank you

**2. No portfolio showing real work**
- Problem: QuickMela, DriverBharat, AI agents — all invisible to potential clients
- Fix: Add 3-5 case studies with screenshots, tech stack, challenges, outcomes
- Cost: 1-2 days of content work
- Revenue impact: Without proof, 90% of visitors bounce without contacting you

**3. Generic positioning**
- Problem: "AI, web development, mobile apps" = 200+ Hyderabad companies
- Fix: Niche down to "AI Marketplace & Platform Development"
- Cost: 0 (just rewrite copy)
- Revenue impact: Specialists charge 2-3x more than generalists

### 🟡 HIGH — Fix in Month 1

**4. Not listed on B2B discovery platforms**
- Register: Clutch.co, GoodFirms.co, DesignRush.com, TheManifest.com
- Get 5+ reviews on each within 30 days
- Expected result: 2-3 inbound leads/month within 60 days of listing

**5. LinkedIn Company Page incomplete**
- Complete full description, add showcase pages
- Post 2x/week — share work, AI insights, case studies
- Connect with 500 CTOs/founders/PMs in month 1

**6. No productized pricing**
- Add pricing page with 3 tiers (₹3L / ₹8L / ₹20L+)
- Reduces sales cycle from weeks to days

### 🔵 MEDIUM — Fix in Month 2-3

**7. No international market presence**
- Create Upwork agency profile focused on AI marketplace development
- Target US/UK startup founders via LinkedIn outreach
- First project at any price just to get a review

**8. No content marketing**
- Start blog: 2 posts/month on "Building AI platforms for India"
- SEO takes 6-12 months but compounds. Start now.

**9. Authorized capital too low**
- Upgrade from ₹1L to ₹25-50L via MCA SH-7 form
- Cost: ~₹5,000
- Impact: Enterprise clients check MCA. ₹1L signals freelancer, not company.

## 📢 CONTENT PROMPT TEMPLATES

[specific feature/project detail].

Show proof (numbers, complexity, outcomes). 
End with a question or CTA for startup founders/CTOs.

```
Subject: Built a full AI marketplace platform in 90 days — relevant to [Company]?

Hi [Name],

I'm Santhosh from Tekvoro in Hyderabad. We build AI-powered platforms for 
Indian startups.

We just finished building QuickMela — a real-time auction marketplace with 
AI fraud detection, WhatsApp bot integration, multi-language support, and 
full KYC flows. The whole thing in 90 days.

I noticed [Company] is working on [their product area]. I think the same 
approach — AI-native, India-market-ready — could be very useful for you.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call this week? Happy to show you what we 
built.

Tekvoro.com | Hyderabad
```

### Proposal Introduction (copy-paste into proposals):
```
Tekvoro Technologies is a Hyderabad-based AI platform development studio 
with a proven track record of building production-grade, AI-native 
marketplaces and SaaS products for Indian startups.

Our flagship work includes QuickMela, a full-stack AI auction marketplace 
featuring real-time bidding, AI fraud detection (shill bidding ring 
detection via Graph Neural Network), KYC AI with liveness detection, 
WhatsApp NLP support bot, 8-language voice support, and GST/TCS compliance 
automation. This was delivered in 90 days and represents the complexity and 
quality of what we build.

We are not a generalist agency. We specialize in AI-powered platforms, 
and we bring pre-built components, integrations, and experience that

```

## 🏆 COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES (Use in Every Pitch)

1. **Platform proof** — We've shipped a real, complex AI marketplace. Not mockups. Not MVPs. Production-grade with 22 admin panels, AI fraud detection, KYC, payments, and multi-language support.

2. **AI-native from day 1** — We don't "add AI later." We architect for AI from the start. Our systems use Gemini, Whisper, Sarvam AI, Google Vision, and custom ML models.

3. **India-market expertise** — UPI, WhatsApp-first UX, Aadhaar KYC, GST compliance, multi-language (22 Indian languages), 18-state logistics zones. US dev teams can't do this.

4. **Speed** — 90-day delivery for complex platforms. Competitors take 12-18 months.

5. **Hyderabad base** — India's #2 AI hub. Tier-1 talent at Tier-2 costs. Better value than Bangalore/Mumbai agencies.

## 💡 QUICK REFERENCE — WHEN STUCK

### "How do I write copy for X?"
Use the positioning prompt above. Always mention QuickMela as proof. Always lead with the outcome, not the technology.

### "How do I price this project?"
Start from the service menu above. Add 20% for anything involving AI model integration. Add 15% for tight timelines (<4 weeks). Discount up to 15% for 6-month+ retainer commitments.

### "How do I answer: why should I trust a company founded 4 months ago?"
> "Our company is new, but our experience isn't. The QuickMela platform we built includes production-grade AI fraud detection, KYC AI, and real-time auction infrastructure that most agencies can't build at any age. We'd rather show you the work than argue about years of existence. Want to see it?"

### "What makes us different from [competitor]?"
> "Most agencies in Hyderabad do web/mobile development. We build AI-native platforms — the kind where AI isn't an add-on but the core architecture. We have proof: a working, deployed auction marketplace with fraud detection, KYC AI, and multi-language NLP. That's our moat."

### "When is the right time to hire?"
When you have 2 concurrent projects running or ₹15L+ in ARR. Hire full-stack AI developers first (₹8-10L CTC). Remote-first is fine.
